# Notes
These notes are my revision notes which I compile from various sources as I studied for the exams. It includes notes made by me during or after class. I wrote down whatever I felt was important, likely to be tested, or easy to forget. I personally found these really helpful to prepare for exams and hope they are useful for you too!
