### Phases of Indian Sociology:
1. **Colonial Modernity and Anthropology**: Study of Indian societies through colonial lenses.
   - **Methods**:
     - Ethnographic studies categorized communities into castes/tribes.
     - Anthropometric tools (e.g., skull measurements) reinforced racial hierarchies.
   - **Critique**: Reinforced Brahminical dominance and static views of Indian society.
   - **Key Schools**:
     - **Bombay School (Ghurye)**: Emphasized Hindu civilization and caste.
     - **Lucknow School (Mukherjee)**: Interdisciplinary, empirical approach.

2. **Nationalist Sociology**:
   - **Thinkers**:
     - **M.N. Srinivas**: Studied villages and caste systems; introduced concepts like "Sanskritization."
     - **A.R. Desai**: Marxist critique of nationalism and class dynamics.
   - **Focus**: Harmonious village systems vs. critiques of inequality.

3. **Post-1970s Challenges**:
   - **Themes**:
     - Globalization and communalism.
     - Rise of subaltern, feminist, and Dalit critiques.
   - **Shift**: From state-centric development to diverse, interdisciplinary approaches.

### Key Terms:
- **Indological Approach**: Studying society through Hindu scriptures (critiqued for Brahminical bias).
- **Sanskritization**: Lower castes adopting upper-caste practices to gain status.

1. Karl Marx: Alienation: Estrangement of workers under capitalism from their labor, products, and humanity.
	1. From Product
	2. From Process/ Labour
	3. From others
	4. From Human Specificity
	Capitalism dehumanizes by reducing labor to a commodity.
2. Max Weber: Social Action and Rationality
	1. Social Action Theory: Actions are "social" when intended to influence others and carry subjective meaning.
	2. Rational Acction
		1. Zweckrational (Instrumental)
		2. Wertrational (Value Rational)
		3. Affective
		4. Traditional
	3. Protestant Ethic: Calvinist work ethic (hard work, frugality) fueled capitalism.
	4. Iron Cage: Bureaucratic rationality stifling human spontaneity.
3. Emile Durkheim: 
	1. Solidarity
		1. Mechanical Solidarity: Pre-industrial societies with shared norms (e.g., tribal communities).
		2. Organic Solidarity: Industrial societies with interdependent roles (e.g., specialized labor).
		3. Anomie: intermediate transient state
	2. Law
		1. Repressive: Punitive (e.g., traditional societies).
		2. Restitutive: Restorative (e.g., modern contract law).


## Key Definitions and Keywords
- **Verstehen (Weber)**: Empathetic understanding of social actions.

These notes synthesize core concepts, thinkers, and critiques from the lectures, providing a comprehensive overview for study.

**Sociological Analytical Frameworks**
1. Marxian
2. Weberian
3. Durkheimian

**Marxian Framework** *Karl Marx*
Based on *Alienation* of labour on four bases.
1. Alienation of the Product
2. Alienation of the Process
3. Alienation of the Specific Humanity
4. Alienation of the Other
For Marx, alienation remains, that is, the situation when "man's own deed becomes an alien power opposed to him, which enslave him instead of being controlled by him‚Äù (Munshi 1979).


**Durkheimian Framework** *Emile Durkheim*
Based on *Solidarity*
1. Mechanical Solidarity: All people do same work based on age and sex. Uniformity of work creates solidarity.
2. Organic Solidarity: Complex division of labour, highly interdependent on each other. Difference in labour creates solidarity.
Anomie: Transient phase between mechanical solidarity to organic solidarity, meaninglessness of work.
Forced Division of labour on the basis of natural inequalities like sex.

Repressive Law: Based on punishment because crime is an offense to all the members of the community and a threat to social unity.
Restitutive Law: Based on restoration because aim is to restore the originals situation.

**Weberian Framework** *Max Weber*
Based on *Rationality* and *Social Action*
There are 4 types of social actions.
1. Zweckrational: the actor has a clearly conceived goal combined with a means to achieve it
2. Wertrational: the actor has a value which they are trying to preserve through a means, remain faithful to their idea of honour
3. Affective: the state of mind or humour of the actor lead them to that action
4. Traditional: as dictated by customs and traditions, obeying societal norms
