Philosophy is everywhere. Philosophical questions often arise in our everyday conversations and 
An argument is a series of steps from a premise to a conclusion, such that anyone who reads the argument should be able to get from the premise to the conclusion.
What differentiates a good or rational or logical argument from a bad or irrational or illogical argument?
A good argument is one where the premises give us "good" reason to believe in the conclusion.
If an argument is analogised to a building, then
1. the floors would be the premises
2. the roof would be the conclusion
3. the cement would be the inference
The foundation of a good argument is always the laws of logic.


Humans are not perfectly logical. People often fall for sentiment or emotion over logic and reasoning. That is how propaganda works. That is why people often have false beliefs. What grounds the truth of inference? What makes it a higher truth?


Logic is the *art of self defense*.
Against bad arguments, rhetoric, or non reasonable ways of persuasion and propaganda.
But why should we be reasonable?

We make inferences all the time.

**Inferences**
1. Inductive (Scientific): Sense of probability, matter of degree
	1. Features
		1. ampliative: give additional information that is not already in the premises.
		2. non monotonic: can always be made weaker or stronger
		3. sample to a population OR
		4. correlation to casual generalisation (not actual causation)
	2. Legitimate because
		1. Principle of Uniformity of Nature: the future will always be like the past
		2. Circularity with Inductive Inference
2. Deductive (Mathematical): Certainty, absolute, non ampliative

**Logic**
1. Informal Logic: the content or the meaning of the premises gives it its truth value
	1. identifying fallacies in everyday logic
	2. critical thinking
2. Formal Logic: the form or the structure of arguments gives it its truth
	1. Categorical Propositions (Talks about categories, not existence) 
		1. $\text{all } S \text { is } P$
		2. $\text{no } S \text { is } P$
		3. $\text{some } S \text { is } P$
		4. $\text{some } S \text { is not } P$
	2. Syllogisms: $A \rightarrow B, B \rightarrow C \implies A \rightarrow C$
	3. Propositional Logic
	4. Truth Tables
	5. Predicate Logic (FOL)

Philosophy is not just opinion. It is about how agreement or disagreement can be given reasons in support.

An argument is sound if it is valid and all its premises are true.
Arguments can be valid or invalid.
Premises can be true or false.
Arguments cannot be true or false, and premises cannot be valid or invalid.


**Laws of Thought** *Aristotle*
1. Law of Non Contradiction (*Reductio ad absurdum!*)  $$A \text{ or }\lnot A, \text{ not both}$$
2. Law of the Excluded Middle $$A \text{ or }\lnot A, \text{ not neither}$$
3. Law of Self Identity $$A = A$$

**Impossibility**
1. Physically Impossible: defies the laws of nature (Ex. a man jumping from the earth to the moon)
2. Logically Impossible: defies the laws of logic (Ex. married bachelor)
(A statement can be both or neither or either one asw.)

"Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world!"
\~*Archimedes*
(physically impossible)

**John Searle's Chinese Room Argument**


**Fallacies of Deductive Inference**
$$\text{if A then B}$$
Antecedent: $\text A$
Consequent: $\text B$
Antecedent is a sufficient condition for the consequent, that is, it is a guarantee.
Consequent is a necessary condition for the antecedent, it is a minimum requirement, without which it is not possible.
1. Modus Ponens (Valid: Affirming the Antecedent)
   $$\text A\therefore \text B $$
   Invalid (Fallacy of Denying the Antecedent)$$\lnot \text A \therefore \lnot\text B$$ 
2. Modus Tollens (Valid: Denying the Consequent)
   $$\lnot\text B \therefore \lnot \text A$$
   Invalid (Fallacy of Affirming the Consequent) $$ \text B\therefore \text A$$

A fallacy is an argument that seems to be correct, but on examination proves to not be.
**Sophistry**
An argument that is known to be misleading or illogical
**Fallacy**
Innocently used by speaker, not knowing it is illogical



**Types of Fallacies** *Argumentum*
1. Relevance
	1. Appeal to Populace (ad populum): Emotions and arousing feelings of the multitude
	2. Appeal to Emotion (ad misericordium): Pity
	3. Red Herring: Distraction, deliberately misleading trail
	4. Straw Man: Misrepresent the opponent's position 
	5. Attack on Person (Ad Hominem)
		1. Abusive, guilt by association
		2. Circumstantial
			1. Tu Quoque: you too!
			2. Poisoning the well: Attack the opponent's intention
	6. Appeal to Force (ad Baculum): Threat, physical or otherwise
	7. Missing the point (Ignoratio Elenchi) (irrelevant conclusion/ non sequitur): 
2. Deductive Induction
	1. Argument from/ Appeal to Ignorance (ad Ignorantiam): because it has not been proved false
	2. Appeal to Inappropriate Authority (ad Verecundiam): According to experts/ God/ the PM etc.
	3. False Cause (non Causa pro Causa):
		1. post hoc ergo propter hoc: after this != because of this
		2. slippery slope: change in a particular direction is asserted to inevitably lead to further changes in the same direction
	4. Hasty Generalisation (fallacy of converse accident)
3. Presumption
	1. Accident: A true generalisation need not apply in a particular case
	2. Complex Question (Plurium Interrogationum): Both yes and no have a presupposition
	3. Begging the Question (Petitio Principii): circular argument
4. Ambiguity
	1. Equivocation: Switch between different (semantic) meanings of a phrase 
		1. Relative terms: An elephant is an animal, therefore a small elephant is a small animal.
	2. Amphiboly: Switch between different meanings due to syntax of a sentence (syntactic constructions)
	3. Accent: Fallacy due to stress or emphasis on a different word
	4. Composition
		1. Parts of Whole: Every part of the machine is light, thus the machine is also light.
		2. Individuals to Totality (Invalid Inference): Every car produces less CO2 than every bus. Therefore, all cars produce more CO2 together than all buses put together.
	5. Division: (Reverse of Composition)
		1. Whole to parts: 
		2. Attributes from collection to individual elements: Dogs are common as pets. Afghan hounds are dogs. Therefore, Afghan hounds are common as pets.
False dichotomy
Distinction without difference
Whataboutism
