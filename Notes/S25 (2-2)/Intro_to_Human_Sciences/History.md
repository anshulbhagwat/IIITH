# **E H Carr**
According to Carr -> Objectivity does not truly exist, but to try and attain it is far from futile.
"Objective history does not exist."
"To assert that fallible human beings are much too entangled in circumstances of time and space to attain the absolute truth, is not the same thing as to deny the existence of truth; such a denial destroys any possible criterion of judgement, and makes any approach to history as true or as false as any other."
"It is possible to maintain that objective truth exists but that no historian by himself or no school of historians by itself, can hope to achieve more than a faint and partial approximation of it."


**Preface**
The ideas of society are the ideas of its ruling class.
There is no 'objective' historical truth.
Facts.

Ranke -> *wie es eigentlich gewesen*
Positivists -> ascertain facts then draw conclusions
British Empiricist tradition -> complete separation of subject and object, facts are independent of the observer's conscience.
Common Sense View of History
Facts are available to the historian, and he chooses which ones and how he presents them.
CP Scott: "Facts are sacred, opinion is free."

Carr: "This will not do."
Not all facts of the past are historical facts.
According to common sense view, there are certain basic facts which form the backbone of history and which are the same for all historians.
**Problems**
1. "Accuracy is a duty, not a virtue." ~ Housman : Basic facts are the raw materials of the historians rather than of history itself.
2. It is the historian who decides which facts are historical and presents them. Facts do not speak for themselves, but only when historians call upon them, and in which order and with what context.

Example of 
German - English Translator Sutton (1 Book) from Secretary Bernhard (3 Volumes) (Stresemanns Vermächtnis) from Gustav Stresemann's 300 boxes of documents (foreign minister of Weimar Republic), most of his Eastern Policy, esp. regarding the Soviet Union, which was largely unsuccessful was omitted time and again. It actually began with Stresemann himself, who put down his thoughts and conversations for a majority of the time, and his opponents as short and incoherent.
Do not make a fetish out of facts and documents.
The doctrine of primacy and the autonomy of facts

All history is 'contemporary history’, declared Croce: history consists essentially in seeing the past through the eyes of the present and in the light of its problems, and that the main work of the historian is not to record, but to evaluate; for, if he does not evaluate, how can he know what is worth recording ? 
In 1910 the American historian, Carl Becker, argued in deliberately provocative language that “the facts of history do not exist for any historian till he creates them.
The views of Collingwood can be summarized as follows. The philosophy of history is concerned neither with ’the past by itself’ nor with ’the historian’s thought about it by itself’, but with ‘ the two things in their mutual relations '. (This dictum reflects the two current meanings of the word ‘history’ - the inquiry conducted by the historian and the series of past events into which he inquires.)
‘The past which a historian studies is not a dead past, but a past which in some sense is still living in the present.’ But a past act is dead. Le. meaningless to the his torian, unless he can understand die thought that lay behind it. Hence 'all history is the history of thought’, and 'history is the re-enactment in the historian’s mind of the thought whose his tory he is studying’.
The reconstitution of the past in the his torian’s mind is dependent on empirical evidence. But it is not in itself an empirical process, and cannot consist in a mere recital of facts. On the contrary, the process of reconstitution governs the selection and interpretation of the facts : this, indeed, is what makes them historical facts. 'History’,says Professor Oakeshott, who on this point stands near to Collingwood, ' is the historian’s experience. It is " made ” by nobody save the historian : to write history is the only way of making it.’



1. What is a fact? What is a historical fact? What is a historian's job? Quote with examples.
2. Explain the relationship between the individual and society. What is the great men theory?
3. What is progress? What is the teleological view of history? Renaissance, Enlightenment? What is the end of history as per Fukuyama? What is liberal democracy.


### Marxist Historiography

Marxist historiography, rooted in the works of **Karl Marx** and **Friedrich Engels**, emphasizes the role of economic structures and class struggle in shaping historical development. Marx’s materialist conception of history posits that the mode of production—the way societies organize to produce and distribute goods—forms the foundation of social, political, and cultural life. According to Marx, history progresses through a series of stages, each characterized by a dominant mode of production (e.g., feudalism, capitalism) and corresponding class relations. The transition from one stage to another is driven by class struggle, as oppressed classes rise up against their oppressors to create a new social order.

Marxist historians focus on the experiences of marginalized groups, particularly the working class and peasants, who are often excluded from traditional historical narratives. They critique elite-centric histories that focus on rulers, politicians, and intellectuals, arguing that such narratives obscure the role of ordinary people in shaping history. For example, E. P. Thompson’s *The Making of the English Working Class* (1963) is a seminal work in Marxist historiography that examines the formation of the working class in England during the Industrial Revolution. Thompson emphasizes the agency of workers in creating their own class identity through collective action and cultural practices, rather than viewing them as passive victims of economic forces.

However, Marxist historiography has been criticized for its Eurocentrism and its tendency to universalize the European historical experience. Critics argue that Marx’s stages of history (e.g., feudalism, capitalism) do not necessarily apply to non-Western societies, where different modes of production and social structures may exist. Additionally, Marxist historians have been accused of economic determinism, or reducing all historical phenomena to economic causes, thereby neglecting the role of culture, ideology, and individual agency.

Despite these criticisms, Marxist historiography remains influential for its emphasis on social and economic structures, its focus on class struggle, and its commitment to uncovering the histories of marginalized groups. It has inspired a wide range of historical studies, from labor history to postcolonial critiques, and continues to shape debates about the nature of historical change.

### Fukuyama’s “End of History”

Francis Fukuyama’s essay *The End of History?* (1989) argues that the collapse of communism and the triumph of liberal democracy mark the endpoint of humanity’s ideological evolution. Drawing on Hegelian philosophy, Fukuyama posits that history is driven by the struggle for recognition and the desire for freedom, which culminate in the establishment of liberal democratic states. According to Fukuyama, the end of the Cold War signaled the victory of liberalism over its ideological rivals, fascism and communism, and the universalization of liberal democracy as the final form of human government.

Fukuyama’s thesis is based on the idea that liberal democracy satisfies the fundamental human desire for recognition and freedom, thereby resolving the contradictions that have driven historical progress. He acknowledges that liberal democracies are not perfect and that challenges such as inequality and social unrest persist. However, he argues that these issues do not represent fundamental contradictions that could lead to the emergence of a new ideological alternative. Instead, they are problems that can be addressed within the framework of liberal democracy.

Critics of Fukuyama’s thesis argue that it is overly optimistic and Eurocentric, as it assumes that liberal democracy is the ultimate goal of all societies. They point to the persistence of authoritarian regimes, religious fundamentalism, and nationalist movements as evidence that history has not ended. Additionally, Fukuyama’s focus on ideological evolution has been criticized for neglecting the role of economic, cultural, and environmental factors in shaping historical change.

Despite these criticisms, Fukuyama’s essay remains a provocative and influential contribution to debates about the future of global politics. It raises important questions about the nature of historical progress and the challenges facing liberal democracies in the 21st century.

### Subaltern Studies

The Subaltern Studies collective, founded in the early 1980s by historians such as **Ranajit Guha**, seeks to challenge elite-centric histories and recover the voices of marginalized groups, or “subalterns,” in South Asia. Drawing on Antonio Gramsci’s concept of subalternity, the collective critiques colonial, nationalist, and Marxist historiographies for neglecting the agency of subaltern groups, such as peasants, workers, and women, in shaping history. Subaltern Studies scholars argue that elite histories, whether colonial or nationalist, represent the subaltern as passive and voiceless, thereby reinforcing their marginalization.

Ranajit Guha’s *Elementary Aspects of Peasant Insurgency in Colonial India* (1983) is a key text in the Subaltern Studies project. Guha examines peasant rebellions in 19th-century India, arguing that they were driven by a distinct subaltern consciousness that included religious beliefs, myths, and community bonds. He critiques colonial and nationalist narratives that depict these rebellions as spontaneous or pre-political, emphasizing instead the autonomy and agency of the subalterns.

However, Subaltern Studies has faced criticism for its reliance on colonial and elite texts, which often silence or distort subaltern voices. **Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak**, in her essay *Can the Subaltern Speak?* (1988), argues that the subaltern is often excluded from historical narratives because they lack the means to represent themselves. Spivak uses the example of *sati* (widow immolation) in colonial India to illustrate how both colonial and indigenous elites constructed the subaltern woman as a passive object, denying her the ability to speak for herself.

Despite these challenges, Subaltern Studies has made significant contributions to postcolonial historiography by highlighting the agency of marginalized groups and critiquing the Eurocentrism of traditional historical narratives. It has inspired similar projects in other regions and disciplines, and continues to shape debates about the nature of historical representation.

### E. H. Carr’s *What is History?*

E. H. Carr’s *What is History?* (1961) challenges traditional notions of historical objectivity by arguing that history is a process of selection and interpretation, rather than a mere recounting of facts. Carr critiques the empiricist view of history, which assumes that facts are objective and independent of the historian’s consciousness, and instead emphasizes the active role of the historian in constructing historical narratives. He uses the analogy of a fishmonger’s slab to illustrate how historians select and interpret facts based on their perspective and the questions they seek to answer.

Carr compares the historian to a scientist, arguing that both engage in a process of hypothesis formation and testing. However, he rejects the positivist view that history is a science in the strict sense, as historians cannot conduct experiments and must rely on the interpretation of existing evidence. Carr uses the example of Gustav Stresemann’s papers to illustrate how historians must critically analyze and interpret evidence to reconstruct the past.

Carr also addresses the role of ideology in shaping historical narratives, arguing that historians are inevitably influenced by their social and political context. He critiques the idea that historians can achieve complete objectivity, emphasizing instead the dynamic and reciprocal relationship between the historian and the past. Carr redefines the historian’s role as an active participant in the construction of historical narratives, arguing that history is a “continuous process of interaction between the historian and his facts.”

Carr’s work remains a foundational text in the philosophy of history, challenging traditional notions of objectivity and offering a new framework for understanding the historian’s role in interpreting the past.

### Society vs. Individual

E. H. Carr’s exploration of the relationship between society and the individual is central to his understanding of history. He rejects the notion that society and the individual are opposing forces, arguing instead that they are inseparable and mutually constitutive. Carr draws on **John Donne’s famous line, “No man is an island,”** to emphasize that individuals are inherently social beings, shaped by the societies into which they are born. Language, thought, and even the earliest ideas are social acquisitions, not individual inheritances. Carr critiques the classical **individualist** view, as espoused by **J.S. Mill**, which posits that individuals retain their essence regardless of societal influence. He argues that individuals do not exist in a pre-social state; from birth, they are molded by their social environment.

Carr uses the example of **Robinson Crusoe** to illustrate this point. Despite being isolated on an island, Crusoe is not an abstract individual but an Englishman shaped by his societal background, carrying with him the cultural and religious baggage of his time. Crusoe’s eventual creation of a new society with Friday further underscores the idea that individuals cannot exist independently of social structures. Carr also critiques the myth of individualism, particularly as it emerged during the Renaissance and Enlightenment. He argues that the increased individualization of modern society is a natural outcome of advancing civilization, not a liberation from societal constraints. Carr’s view is that the development of society and the individual go hand in hand, with each shaping and being shaped by the other.

### Historical Progress

E. H. Carr’s conceptualization of historical progress is both dynamic and nuanced. He rejects chaotic and cyclical views of history, arguing instead that history follows a directional trajectory marked by advances and retreats. Carr contrasts the classical civilizations of Greece and Rome, which were largely ahistorical and indifferent to the future, with the Jewish and Christian traditions, which introduced a teleological view of history. This teleological perspective, though initially theological, was later secularized by Enlightenment thinkers like Gibbon, who saw history as progress toward the perfection of human society.

Carr acknowledges periods of regression and deviation but insists that these do not negate the overall forward movement of history. He critiques simplistic teleological views, such as Hegel’s vision of the Prussian monarchy as the culmination of historical progress or Marx’s prediction of a classless society. Instead, Carr proposes a more flexible and dynamic conception of progress, one that is not tied to a specific end but is continually redefined as humanity advances. He emphasizes the interplay of material and moral progress, highlighting the need for social and moral development to keep pace with technological advancements.

Carr also underscores the historian’s role in shaping narratives of progress. He argues that history is not a purely objective record of events but a process of interpretation in which the historian selects and evaluates facts based on their significance. This process of interpretation is inherently subjective, as it is influenced by the historian’s social and historical context. However, Carr also argues that the historian can achieve a degree of objectivity by recognizing their own biases and by projecting their vision into the future. In Carr’s view, the historian’s task is not merely to record the past but to illuminate its significance for the future, helping to guide humanity on its ongoing journey of progress.
