A fully fashioned Speech Accepted by a nation becomes a language
Language can be seen as a unitary language or overlapping structures (dialects).
Structural -> descriptive of language
Functional -> descriptive of its usage
Vernacular -> undeveloped dialect (not in use for wide range of functions) 
language to dialect, vernacular to standard: (a) selection of norm, (b) codification of form, (c) elaboratiog of function, and (d) acceptance by the community

| ***Language*** | Codification | Elaboration |

Arabic -> Christian vs Muslim Dialect, Egyptian vs Modern Standard Arabic 
Modern Greek ->
Swiss German -> Schwyzerduuts being replaced with Hochdeutsch
Haitian Creole with French

Arabic -> slowly developing towards different standards based on regional L, heavy H borrowings
Swiss -> Relatively stable, more dominance of H slowly
Creole -> L slowly devloping into standard
Greek -> fully developed into standard based on L, heavy H borrowings

They differ in
1. Function
2. Prestige (Religion too)
3. Literary Heritage
4. Acquisition (L is first learnt by children)
5. Standardization (H is standardized and widespread, L is understudied and more varying)
6. Stability: Stable for long time, admixture, borrowings from H to L
7. Grammar: L often has much fewer structures wrt conjugation and inflection. Difference in grammar exists
8. Lexicon: Vastly same, however more technical terms in H and more common in L. However, even common words are different (in pairs) in H and L.
9. Phonology: (Strikingly different Schwyzerduuts), similar (Arabic, Creole), very close (Greek). Phonemes in H may be regularly replaced by other phonemes in borrowing from H to L if it doesn't exist in L 

A is simpler than B if:
1. Morphophonemics are more regular/simpler
2. Fewer obligatory marked categories
3. symmetrical paradigms
4. stricter concord

A language with no native speakers and a drastically reduced structure and lexicon is called a *pidgin*.
A pidgin which has become the native language of a speech community is called a *creole*.
They both have definable and describable grammatical structures, albeit markedly different from the "source languages".

| source language | creole                                   |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| English         | Pidgin Englishes                         |
| French          | Haiti, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Mauritius |
| Spanish         | Papiamentu                               |
etc.

Until recently they Pidgins and Creoles were not studied because it was considered that they were corrupt languages, often spoken by preliterate, prestigeless groups. It was further disfavoured because of it being the dislocation from the standard was easily recognisable to both native and non native speakers.

**Characteristics of Pidgins and Creoles**
1. Reduced Grammatical Structures (often derived from other pos) Ex. HC "*mwe ap maze*" from *apres* in French, means I am eating.
2. Shifts in Meaning (Primarily Semantic Broadening) Ex. in Guine Crioulu, "*əəbi*" can mean hear or understand, from Portuguese *ouvi*, "*kaloor*" from *calor* can mean heat or sweat.


Tok Pisin, Bislama, Haitian Creole

Wrt establishment of creole standards, since usually only spoken by lower class, often dialect of the administrative centre is chosen. Ex. Haiti - Port au Prince dominance
The orthography is also often a compromise and may be differently phonetically realised by different speech communities. additional pressure from dominant language to conform.
Often bible translations or use of the pidgin and creole in the missionary context is the first step to recognition and function as a standard.
Wrt to education in these standards, it is low prestige. Parents are themselves often unwilling to send their children to be taught in these languages primarily.
A creole is fully accepted as a standard if it is used for 1. Fully official (governmental), 2. Bellettristic 
Any language has to combat prejudice to be a standard, but creoles and pidgins have to additionally battle whether they are a debased form of the source language.

Major example is Indonesian from Bazaar Malay. (For HC still battles french)


**Language Use in Multilingual Societies**
In many multilingual societies the choice of one language over another h same signification as the selection among lexical alternates in homogeneous societies.
That speech has functions other than referential, and that stylistic and other shifts in the linguistic content of discourse often serve to mark off shifts.
Factors commonly attributed to determining code: participants, setting or context, topic, channel, message form, mood or tone, and intentions and effects.

1. Multi-code situations: extremely frequent and rapid switching
2. difficulty in attributing segments to one code or the other: especially true in cases involving diglossia

Labov on English in New York City (1966) and more recently on non standard Negro English (1969)
1. the variants are said to belong to different systems, and the alternation is an example of 'dialect mixture' or 'code switching'
2. the variants are said to be in 'free variation' within the same system, and the selection lies below the level of linguistic structure

**Elaborated and Restricted Code**
every time the child speaks or listens, the social structure of which he is part is reinforced and his social identity is constrained
children have access to different speech systems and linguistic codes because of their social standings, thus the intellectual and social procedures are not related purely to their psychological ability.
The term code refers to the principles which regulate the verbal planning function. Three stages of this function are distinguished: 
1. Orientation: the receiver scans incoming messages for a pattern of dominant signals; 
2. Association: associations to the pattern of dominance control selections from the store of words and extraverbal signals; 
3. Organization: the selected words are fitted within grammatical frames and integrated with extraverbal signals. 

It follows that restricted and elaborated codes will establish different kinds of control which crystallize in the nature of verbal planning



**WORK**
1. Go through last years' papers
2. Crioles and Pidgins
3. Go through new H2 seminar papers
4. Go through H1 notes

**Features of Creoles**
1. Reduced Phonology
2. Reduced Lexicon
3. Reduced Structure
4. New Phonological patterns like Reduplication (Melanesian English: sip-*ship*, sip sip -*sheep*)
5. Semantic Broadening (Guine Crioulu: əəbi - *hear, understand*, kaloor - *heat, sweat*) 
6. Repurposing other POS (Haitin Creole: mwe ap-maje - *I am eating*)
7. Compounding (Melanesian English: hosmen- *stallion*, hosmeri- *mare*)
8. Simplification (Counter Example: Inclusive Exclusive We in Bislama Yumi, Mifala)

**Theories of Origin of Pidgins**
1. Monogenesis
2. Polygenesis
3. Baby Talk
Why are they so similar? If not monogenesis or baby talk (which were proven wrong)?
According to Todd, all human beings have the ability to create simple communication systems from the environment.

**Creolization**
Due to Bioprogramme by Bickerton, that children have this innate linguistic blueprint which allows them to expand the structure of the pidgin, wrt phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon.
It is not sudden, both the creole and the pidgin may be maintained for generations, until when the need arises, and the pidgin changes to the creole. (Gradualism)

**Features of Creoles** (*Anglocentric*)
1. Multiple negation: I don't want nothing.
2. Zero Copula: She a doctor, You smart. 
3. Serial Verbs: I tol pas mi (He is taller than me, he tall pass me)
4. Complementizer 'say':  They told me say they couldn't get it.

There are two codes
1. Elaborate
2. Restricted

Schools only accept elaborated code, which lower classes often do not have access to. Black children often did not have access to the elaborate code, so they were deemed culturally and verbally deficit.
How can they be "repaired?" Of course they could not, because they were never broken. But this was attributed to their "cognitive deficiency" which must be genetic.

1. They cannot form full sentences.
2. They cannot convey logical thought.
3. They cannot grasp concepts.

Labov: this is dangerous, does not account for white education system.
He changed the settings, into one which made them feel more comfortable by:
1. Using taboo words (like piss and shit)
2. Having their peers with them

Also, the features which they deemed illogical and ungrammatical were just features in non standard varieties of English, which are also very common in other non English languages like Zero Copula, Double Negation, Ellipsis in Discourse etc.
Middle class were more likely to be verbose with lesser logic.


### *1. Do you agree that "Language is linguistically superior to a dialect"? Give examples to justify your answer.*
   - *Answer*: 
     No, linguistically, a language is not superior to a dialect. The distinction between a language and a dialect is sociopolitical rather than linguistic. 
     - A *language* is typically recognized with official status, a standardized grammar, and prestige, while a *dialect* is a regional or social variation of a language. For example:
       - *Mandarin and Cantonese* are considered dialects of Chinese but are not mutually intelligible. Mandarin has political prestige as the standard language of China.
       - *Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian* are mutually intelligible but are considered separate languages due to political and cultural identities.
     - Linguistically, both languages and dialects have systematic grammar, phonology, and vocabulary, and no variety is inherently superior to another.

---

### *2. What is a "language continuum"? Discuss the role of "mutual intelligibility" in drawing language boundaries.*
   - *Answer*: 
     A *language continuum* is a series of geographically adjacent dialects or languages that gradually change across regions, with neighboring varieties being mutually intelligible but distant ones not. 
     - *Example*: In the Romance language continuum, speakers of northern Italian dialects can understand southern French dialects, but Italian and French are considered separate languages.
     - *Mutual intelligibility* helps define language boundaries. When two speech forms are no longer intelligible to each other (e.g., Dutch and German), they are often classified as distinct languages. However, sociopolitical factors also play a significant role, as seen in the cases of Hindi and Urdu or Serbian and Croatian.

---

### *3. What was the impetus for systematically studying regional and social language variation? Discuss the competence/performance dichotomy.*
   - *Answer*: 
     - Sociolinguistics emerged as scholars recognized that language varies systematically across regions and social groups, challenging the idea of a single "correct" language. William Labov's studies in New York and Martha's Vineyard revealed the connection between social identity and linguistic variation.
     - *Competence/Performance dichotomy* (Noam Chomsky):
       - *Competence*: A speaker's internalized knowledge of language rules (idealized and abstract).
       - *Performance*: How language is actually used, including errors and variability due to social and contextual factors.
     - Sociolinguists focus on *performance* to understand real-world language use and variation, as competence alone doesn’t capture social factors influencing language.

---

### *4. What do you understand by a "bundle of isoglosses"? What are focal, relic, and transitional areas?*
   - *Answer*:
     - A *bundle of isoglosses* refers to a group of linguistic boundaries (isoglosses) that coincide geographically, marking the transition between distinct dialects or languages. For example, in the *West Germanic dialect continuum*, bundles of isoglosses separate High German from Low German.
     - *Focal area*: A region from which linguistic innovations spread (e.g., urban centers like Paris influencing French).
     - *Relic area*: A region that resists linguistic change and retains older features (e.g., rural communities preserving archaic dialects).
     - *Transitional area*: A region where features of two or more dialects mix due to geographical or social proximity.

---

### *5. What is "style"? Why is the "vernacular style" significant?*
   - *Answer*:
     - *Style* in sociolinguistics refers to the way language varies based on the social context, audience, or purpose of communication. It ranges from formal to informal.
     - *Vernacular style*: The natural, informal variety of language used in everyday life. It reflects a speaker's unmonitored linguistic competence and often carries local or social identity.
     - *Significance*: 
       - William Labov’s studies showed that vernacular style reveals the most authentic linguistic features and is less influenced by prescriptive norms. For instance, vernacular pronunciations in African American English (e.g., "gonna" instead of "going to") highlight systematic grammatical patterns, challenging the stigma of being "incorrect."

---

### *6. What is "elaboration" and "codification" in the context of language standardization?*
   - *Answer*:
     - *Codification*: The process of establishing standard rules for a language, such as grammar, spelling, and vocabulary, often through dictionaries or grammar books. Example: Samuel Johnson’s dictionary helped codify English.
     - *Elaboration*: The process of expanding a language to make it suitable for new functions, such as academic discourse, legal contexts, or technology. Example: Modern Hindi has been elaborated with new terms for scientific concepts.
     - These processes ensure a language becomes widely accepted and functional for both formal and informal use in society.

---

### *7. Is it possible to study language change in progress?*
   - *Answer*:
     - Yes, it is possible to study language change in progress through two methods:
       1. *Diachronic studies*: Examine language evolution over long periods (e.g., the development of Old English into Modern English).
       2. *Synchronic studies*: Investigate current variation to observe emerging changes. For example:
         - William Labov’s study of post-vocalic "r" in New York City showed that certain speech patterns (e.g., r-pronunciation) were gaining prestige and spreading across social groups.
     - By comparing generational speech differences or regional variation, sociolinguists can trace linguistic innovations as they occur.

---

### *8. What is the role of covert prestige in maintaining stigmatized forms?*
   - *Answer*:
     - *Covert prestige* refers to the hidden social value assigned to non-standard or stigmatized language forms by specific groups.
     - Speakers of stigmatized varieties, like African American English (AAE) or Cockney English, may maintain these forms because they carry *identity, solidarity, and pride* within their community, even though standard forms are socially dominant.
     - For example:
       - In Labov’s study of AAE, non-standard grammar like "He be working" conveys habitual action and aligns with community norms.
       - Stigmatized forms persist because they assert resistance to mainstream norms and strengthen in-group membership.
